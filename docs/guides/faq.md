# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is the Retro Game Engine?
The Retro Game Engine is a Python-based 2D game engine built on top of Pygame, designed for creating retro-style games with modern development practices.

### What Python versions are supported?
The engine supports Python 3.9 and above.

## Technical Questions

### How do I handle input in my game?
```python
from retro_game_engine import Input, Key

# Check for keyboard input
if Input.is_key_pressed(Key.SPACE):
    player.jump()

# Check for continuous input
if Input.is_key_down(Key.RIGHT):
    player.move_right()
```

### How do I play audio?
```python
from retro_game_engine import AudioManager

# Load and play a sound
audio_manager = AudioManager()
audio_manager.load_sound("jump", "assets/jump.wav")
audio_manager.play_sound("jump")
```

### How do I create a new scene?
```python
from retro_game_engine import Scene

class GameScene(Scene):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def update(self, dt: float):
        # Update game logic here
        pass

    def render(self):
        # Render game objects here
        pass
```

### How do I manage game states?
Use the SceneManager to handle different game states:
```python
from retro_game_engine import SceneManager

scene_manager = SceneManager()
scene_manager.register_scene("menu", MenuScene)
scene_manager.register_scene("game", GameScene)
scene_manager.push_scene("menu")
```

## Performance

### How do I optimize my game?
1. Use sprite batching for rendering multiple sprites
2. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
3. Use the physics system's spatial partitioning
4. Keep the update loop efficient

### What's the recommended way to handle large tilemaps?
Use the built-in TileMap system which includes:
- Efficient rendering with culling
- Collision detection optimization
- Layer support
- TMX file format support

## Troubleshooting

### Why isn't my game running at the target FPS?
1. Check if you're doing too much work in the update loop
2. Verify that your assets are optimized
3. Use the performance metrics to identify bottlenecks:
```python
game_loop = GameLoop(update, render)
print(f"FPS: {game_loop._metrics.fps}")
print(f"Frame Time: {game_loop._metrics.frame_time}ms")
```

### How do I debug collision issues?
1. Enable debug rendering for colliders
2. Check collision layers and masks
3. Verify object positions and sizes
4. Use the physics debug tools
